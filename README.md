# Project Setup and Start Guide

This project uses Laravel as the framework and SQLite as the database. To set up and start the project, follow these steps:

## Step 1: Clone the Project

Clone the project repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git
```

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using Composer:

```bash
composer install
```

## Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update the database settings to use SQLite:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

In the `.env` file, set the following:

```
DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
DB_DATABASE=/path/to/your/database.sqlite
```
Replace `/path/to/your/database.sqlite` with the actual path where you want to store the SQLite database file.

## Step 4: Generate Application Key

Generate a new application key using the following command:

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

## Step 5: Run Migrations

Run the migrations to set up the database schema:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

## Step 6: Seed the Database (Optional)

If you want to populate the database with some initial data, run the following command:

```bash
php artisan db:seed
```

## Step 7: Start the Development Server

Start the development server using the following command:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to access the project.
